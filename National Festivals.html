<font face="Times New Roman" size=5 color=white style="background-color:black;"><p style="background-color:black;">Diwali is a Hindu religious <u>festival of <font color=orange>lights</font></u> and is one of the most important festivals within Hinduism. The festival usually lasts five days, or six in some regions of India, and is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar month Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November).One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, <font color=yellow>Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance".</font> The festival is widely associated with <font color=yellow>Lakshmi</font>, goddess of prosperity and Ganesha, god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles, with many other regional traditions connecting the holiday to Sita and Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Furthermore, it is a celebration of the day <b>Rama</b> returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his <font color=pink>Wife Sita</font> and his <font color=yellowgreen>Brother Lakshmana</font> after defeating the <font color=red>demon Ravana in Lanka</font> and serving 14 years of exile.</p>
In the lead-up to Deepavali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colorful art circle patterns). During Diwali, people wear their <i>finest clothes</i>, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of <b>prosperity and wealth</b>,light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where <font color=orange>mithai (sweets)</font> and gifts are shared. Originally a Hindu festival, <b>Diwali</b> has transcended religious lines and is also celebrated by Jains and Sikhs. It is a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain diaspora.The <u>five-day long</u> festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts. Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the <i>Vijayadashami</i> (Dussehra, Dasara, Dashain) festival, with <font color=lightbrown>Dhanteras</font>, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as <font style="background-color:black;"><font color=red>r</font><font color=orange>a</font><font color=lightyellow>n</font><font color=lightgreen>g</font><font color=skyblue>o</font><font color=blue>l</font><font color=purple>i</font><font color=white>s</font>.This time it is starting from <font color=silver>22nd October to 25th October.<br></font></p></font></font></section>
